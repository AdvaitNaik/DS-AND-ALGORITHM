Data Structures
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.

Types of Data Structure
1. Linear data structure
   In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

2. Non-linear data structure
