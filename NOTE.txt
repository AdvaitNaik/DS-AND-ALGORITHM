What-math-topics-should-I-prepare-for-coding-interviews

1. Basic Algebra - solving linear equations
2. Coordinate Geometry - Single line and how it is represented in 2D coordinates -> (y = mx + c) - useful in geometric problems
3. Permutations & Combinations: n choose k, n pick k

            # we will store the firstElement of array2
            # and left shift all the element and store
            # the firstElement in arr2[k-1]
 
            firstElement = arr2[0];
 
            k = 1;
            for p in range(1, m):
                if(arr2[k] < firstElement):
                    arr2[k - 1] = arr2[k];
                    k += 1;
                
            arr2[k - 1] = firstElement;
